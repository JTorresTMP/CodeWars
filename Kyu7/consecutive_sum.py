# Let's say we have a number, num. Find the number of values of n such that: 
# there exists n consecutive positive values that sum up to num. 
# A positive number is > 0. n can also be 1.

# #Examples
# num = 1
# #1
# return 1

# num = 15
# #15, (7, 8), (4, 5, 6), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# return 4

# num = 48
# #48, (15, 16, 17)
# return 2

# num = 97
# #97, (48, 49)
# return 2

def consecutive_sum(num):
    pass

print(consecutive_sum(1)) #1
print(consecutive_sum(15)) #4
print(consecutive_sum(48)) #2
print(consecutive_sum(97)) #2
